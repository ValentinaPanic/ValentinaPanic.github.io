   I am a foreigner who came to America following my dream. That big dream of mine was to open a Serbian restaurant in the USA.  I studied Management in Hospitality and over the past 10 years, while being in this field I worked hard to educate myself on this industry. Most of my knowledge is in restaurant management.
  That was the career of my choice.
	
  But what happened with all that passion?! Some people say you have to have more than one career in your life and being at this point in my life, I couldn’t agree more. While I loved working in hospitality, it came to the point I felt I wasn’t ‘free’ anymore. Only people who spent some time working in the industry could understand what I mean behind saying that. 
	
    I believe I was a good employee to my employer and an inspiring leader to ‘my staff’. But I was giving it all to other people.  I missed everything that is important and all that because of the nature of this job. All the big holidays, concerts, and dinners I wish I went to. But no, I was working. For other people! So it became a job I was going to, with no desire to be there. 
		
  After all this time, I am super thankful for the experience and wonderful people that became a big part of my life. Hence, it was time to move on.
	
  So, how did Software Engineering come to my life? As silly as it sounds, I feel like it was meant to be.
  It is very scary being over 30 years old, having a husband and a baby, and to decide to study for a new career.
	
  The first time I learned what Software Engineering is about was 2 years ago, when my best friend was thinking about attending an IT school. She inspired me to start thinking about it myself, but it was expensive and I was working approximately 60+ hours per week at the time. So, it looked very intimidating to me.
	
  However, when I think about my childhood I can recognize some hints on why this industry will be perfect for me. At a very young age, I was exposed to the computer. My older brother got one and he was very good at everything that has to do with this piece of machinery. That’s what helped me to be better at IT classes than my classmates. Also, classes like mathematics, statistics, and any other that was practicing logic more than anything else, I was good at. 
	
  Technology is either a friend or enemy to us nowadays. Wherever we turn, it is what we’re surrounded with. It is the industry that will develop constantly. I want that challenge in my life. I want to be able to build an app or create a new language that will impact a lot of people. This industry is creative, demanding and inspiring.
	
  At first, I thought that human interactions are not a big part of this field. Once I dived in, I realized I was wrong and it made me even more exciting about learning to code. 
	
  I am so lucky to come across the app called Career Karma, which main goal is to build the community of individuals who consider getting into the tech world. I found about different boot camps and options for studies. I chose Flatiron because they struck me like they care about their students and the hire rate with them is high. Also, they offer the Income Sharing Agreement in my city. The school will not be a financial burden and instead of focusing on how to pay it now, I can put all my energy into studying and pay once I get the job.
### 	
  Once I finish the full-stack web development course at Flatiron school, I hope I will find the job that will fulfill everything I missed in the restaurant industry. I want to have the balance between my career and family. I want to build something that will make my son being proud of being my kid.
